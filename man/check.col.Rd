\item{expr}{the test expression that will be evaluated}

\item{exists}{shall existence be checked (similar length, class, values)}

\item{failure.exists}{a message that is shown if the variable does not exists (similar the other failure.??? variables)}

\item{failure.message.add}{a text that will be added to all failure messages}
