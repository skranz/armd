\arguments{
\item{var}{a the variable name as string}

\item{expr}{an expression that will be evaluated in the student environment and returns the variable}

\item{length}{shall length be checked (similar dim, class, values)}

\item{failure.length}{a message that is shown if the variable does not exists (similar the other failure.??? variables)}

\item{failure.message.add}{a text that will be added to all failure messages}
